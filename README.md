# Welcome to EdgeGuard Bug Bounty!
This repository does not contain any source code, rather, it is for reporting bugs with EdgeGuard.
## How to report a bug
Go up to the "Issues" tab. Make an issue and follow the template.
Please refrain from reporting bugs in Discord. It doesn't have a good tracking system and I probably will not notice if you do.
## Other uses
You can also suggest features here. I've added some labels to seperate the issues accordingly.

bye bye have fun :3
